Batcher
=====

Batcher is an Aragon App designed to reduce the number of votes that need to be sent to a DAO.

Voting on numerous proposals can be expensive and time-consuming, especially when transactions are required for each vote.

With Batcher, users can authorize thousands of transactions in one single vote, allowing for the efficient management and execution of dependent actions in a more organized and secure way.

This significantly optimizes the voting process, reducing the number of transactions and making the overall governance process more efficient.
